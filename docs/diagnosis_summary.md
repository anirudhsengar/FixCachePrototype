## How to Interpret Results

### Hit Rate

The hit rate measures how often the FixCache correctly predicted which files would contain bugs. A higher hit rate indicates better predictive performance.

- 80-100%: Excellent predictive power
- 60-80%: Very good predictive power
- 40-60%: Good predictive power
- 20-40%: Fair predictive power
- 0-20%: Poor predictive power

### Risk Scores

The risk score for each file indicates the relative likelihood that the file will contain bugs in the future:

- 90-100%: Critical risk - Immediate attention recommended
- 70-90%: High risk - Prioritize for review and refactoring
- 40-70%: Moderate risk - Schedule for review
- 10-40%: Low risk - Monitor during normal development
- 0-10%: Minimal risk - No special attention needed

## Next Steps

To improve your codebase based on these findings:

1. **Review high-risk files** - Schedule code reviews for the top files identified
2. **Increase test coverage** - Focus on adding tests for high-risk components
3. **Consider refactoring** - Files with many bugs may benefit from architectural changes
4. **Re-run regularly** - Bug patterns evolve; run this analysis at least quarterly
5. **Correlate with other metrics** - Compare with code complexity and coverage data
