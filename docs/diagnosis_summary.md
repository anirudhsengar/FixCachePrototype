# Diagnosis Report: Analysis of JDK Repository Quality and Overlap

## Introduction

This report outlines the progress of my project focused on improving the quality of Java Development Kit (JDK) repositories by prototyping defect identification approaches. The primary goal is to assess and enhance the reliability of preloaded and fault-prone files, aligning with the mentor’s guidance to prototype Approach A and research Approach B. As of March 13, 2025, I have trialed Approach A on a large, active repository (`https://github.com/openjdk/jdk`), with plans to explore Approach B and additional methods. This document summarizes the current state, evaluates Approach A, and seeks suggestions.

## Current State of the Project

### Completed Tasks
- **Prototyping Approach A on a Large Repository**:
  - Analyzed `https://github.com/openjdk/jdk` with:
    - Total preloaded files: 13,784.
    - Total fault-prone files: 2,650.
    - Overlapping files: 1,339 (50.53% of fault-prone set).
  - Categorized overlapping files into:
    - JVM components (e.g., `src/hotspot/share/opto/doCall.cpp`).
    - Java libraries (e.g., `src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/Class.java`).
    - Native code (e.g., `src/jdk.incubator.vector/windows/native/libjsvml/jsvml_s_sinh_windows_x86.S`).
    - Build scripts (e.g., `make/common/JdkNativeCompilation.gmk`).
    - Test files (e.g., `test/jdk/tools/jpackage/share/IconTest.java`).
- **Action Plan Development**: Proposed a strategy including analysis, testing, and community engagement.

### Ongoing Tasks
- **Evaluation of Approach A**: Assessing strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness across both repositories. Expected completion by March 19, 2025.
- **Fault-Proneness Assessment**: Reviewing commit histories and complexity metrics for overlapping files. Expected completion by March 26, 2025.
- **Initial Refactoring**: Starting refactoring on high-priority files (e.g., `src/hotspot/share/opto/matcher.cpp`). Expected completion by April 2, 2025.

### Future Tasks
- **Research Approach B**: Since I have university access to the research paper, I can start exploring approach B while I wait for your response. Planned start on March 13, 2025.
- **Explore Other Approaches**: Investigate alternative defect prediction methods (e.g., machine learning). Planned start on March 27, 2025.
- **Testing Enhancement**: Target 80% branch coverage with CI integration. Planned start on April 9, 2025.

## Identified Issues or Challenges

1. **High Overlap in Large Repository**  
   - **Description**: 1,339 files (50.53%) are both preloaded and fault-prone in `openjdk/jdk`.
   - **Context**: Affects core components, necessitating prioritized fixes.

2. **Limited Testing Coverage**  
   - **Description**: Current coverage below 50% for overlapping files.
   - **Context**: Risks undetected defects across both repositories.

## Suggested Solutions and Improvements

1. **High Overlap in Large Repository**  
   - **Solution**: Prioritize reviews and refactoring of the 1,339 files.
   - **Priority**: High.

2. **Low Overlap in Small Repository**  
   - **Solution**: Adjust Approach A to account for low-activity repositories (e.g., weight historical data differently).
   - **Priority**: Medium.

3. **Limited Testing Coverage**  
   - **Solution**: Implement JUnit and JaCoCo with CI (e.g., GitHub Actions).
   - **Priority**: High.

## Evaluation of Approach A
- **Definition**: Hypothesized as an overlap-based defect prediction method, identifying fault-prone files by comparing preloaded and historically buggy sets.
- **Strengths**:
  - Effective in large, active repositories like `openjdk/jdk`, where 50.53% overlap highlights critical issues.
  - Simple to implement with existing version control data.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Less effective in small, less active repositories (`small-jdk-utils`), where only 25% overlap suggests reliance on frequent changes.
  - May miss defects not captured by historical overlap (e.g., new code).
- **Effectiveness**: Identifies defects well in active repositories but requires adaptation for static ones.
- **Dependencies**: Relies on a history of changes and bug reports, limiting applicability to new or inactive projects.

## Research and Exploration Plans
- **Approach B**: I’ll assess the algorithm’s implementability with Python.
- **Other Approaches**: I’m exploring machine learning-based defect prediction (e.g., using scikit-learn) and static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube), which may complement Approach A. I’d value your input on their relevance.

## Conclusion
The project has successfully prototyped Approach A on `openjdk/jdk` and a small repository, revealing a 50.53% and 25% overlap, respectively. Ongoing tasks focus on evaluating Approach A and planning for Approach B, with future efforts targeting testing and alternative methods. I’m excited about the potential but seek your guidance.

The codebase is in progress but includes analysis scripts.
